    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
        Lasagna is a classic Italian dish consisting of layers of wide, flat pasta sheets alternated with rich fillings like ground meat (often beef or sausage), creamy ricotta cheese, mozzarella, and a flavorful tomato sauce, sometimes enriched with herbs like basil and oregano. 
        These layers are repeated and typically topped with a generous amount of cheese that melts and browns in the oven, creating a golden, bubbly crust. 
        The dish is baked until the flavors meld together, resulting in a comforting, savory meal with a deliciously hearty and cheesy texture. 
        Variations might include vegetables, like spinach or mushrooms, and some versions use a creamy b√©chamel sauce to add extra richness.
